Hello! My name is Juan, I am Argentinian. Yes, the country of chaos. I lived most of my life in the country of this meme.

Well I am here since a few years back, my economics teacher told me that excel was not working anymore for according to my needs. Some would say we had a toxic relationship, it wanted me there for hours, and I just used it. But it was not enough for both of us. Okay, I wanted to do a fixing price algorithm (at that time I did not know what an algorithm was) thorugh iterations on a game theory function. This was based on our competitors prices, ours, and some other variables. I was sure I can improve prices and give our customer a good deal! Well, our sales force wanted me buried. A few pages of excel being filled at the same time of the sell... not the best idea. Going back to the story, I showed her the "algorithm", and her face said everything. She introduced me to Python. One of the best and worst moments of my life. I saw her solving all my problems and doing it so smoothly. Then, she told me is your time. Do it and learn. 

It was a few years back, and, obviously, I have to still learning. There are so many interesting projects to do, and soooo much math to learn. But any programming language is not just understanding its logic, which is a lot, but also to know about the subject you want to code about, which is a bigger lot. So, here I am, learning a bit of everythng. Because, I love that, learning.
